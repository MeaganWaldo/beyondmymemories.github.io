L : You've defeating the monster, panting and tired, you sit on the floor, slowing you breath and heartrate.
	You hear sliding from the other side of the room, only to see another dark tunnel, that continues downward.
C : I can rest for a few moments
	As you sit, you feel a tug on your brain
	Then a pull
	Your head feels like its splitting in 2 as a familiar scene returns to you

L : You see a (man/woman) who looks breathtaking standing in front of you.
S : Isn't he just amazing!
L : The (man/woman) glances at you excitedly, before looking back to the furry creature in front of her
S : I can't believe you found one! I thought they were supposed to be rare!
C : They are rare, you wouldn't believe the struggle to just find one of those pups
S : Well, I'm sure it was worth all the struggle. Wouldn't you say so?
L : She starts petting the small dog, it eventually rolls over on its back and gets comfy in her lap
S : X. We'll call you 'X'. Isn't it just perfect for this adorable cloud?
L : X, huh? That's the best you could think of?
S : Oh shut it. Don't listen to him X, you'll be ours forever 
L : The (man/woman) looks back at you once more, smiling with that adorable little dog.
