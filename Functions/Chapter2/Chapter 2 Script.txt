*lands in new area*
L : As you reach the bottom of the stairwell, you enter a dimly lit, circular room
	Unlike normal torches, this room is lit blue, from a center pool in the room
	The water rises, swirling in the center of the room, with sparks of blue lightning between the water
	As you approach the center of the room, a stone slab slams behind you. Closing the stairwell.
	You cannot go back

O :
	2.1.1a: Gaze into the pool
	2.1.1b: Touch the floating water

L : The water swirls around your hand, cold to the touch.

if (!rogue) {
	L : The blue sparks whips out, but being fast, you're able to pull away before it shocks you
}
else {
	L : The blue spark whips out, catching you on you arm. It stings and you pull away as a reflex.
}

	The room shakes as the sound fills the circular space.

//2.1.1//

L : While no one appears to be in the circular space, the water in the pool and floating seem to react to the speaker
	The sparks quake with each word said.
//2.1.2a//

//2.1.2b//
L : You look around, confused from where this voice seems to be coming from.

//2.1.3a//
C : "I don't remember anything" you reply to the rude voice
P : "Hmm... well that is quite rare, but still no matter to me." He replies,
	"I don't care for your kind, you're all the same. You only care about yourself
	So get lost"

O :
	2.1.4a: "I can't go back"

P : "What's it to you? Do you even care? Your kind is all the same. Annoying and selfish.

P : "I cAn'T gO BaCk" he mocks, "I'll give you a hint if you want it, but don't expect anything else from me."

	2.1.6: "Reject the help"
//2.1.4a//

//2.1.4b//
